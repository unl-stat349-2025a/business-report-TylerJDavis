Have you ever been driving over a bridge and wondering how stable it is ? This is a question that has created a lot of buzz recently especially with the state of the infrastructure in the United States. There is a data set that contains all of the information regarding federal, state, and local bridges in the United States, and it is the National Bridge Inventory. This data set contains all of the information needed to estimate and analyze the risk of a bridge collapsing. The data set also contains information to focus on individual state or even latitude and longitude data to focus on certain cities. This brings us to the question at hand and that is, what is the chance that you are driving over a bridge at risk of collapse in Omaha, NE. This question can be answered usign the National Bridge Inventory data set and then focusing in on the Omaha, NE area. This will allow us to gain a greater understanding of the bridge condition in the Omaha area and hopefully allows us a greater understanding of the bridges that are at most risk of collapse in Omaha, NE.
