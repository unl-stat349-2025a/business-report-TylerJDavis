We examine the ways that statisticians have devised to estimate means, variances, correlations and linear regression functions from such data and refer to specific computer programs for carrying out the estimation. We show how the estimation problems can be simplified if the missing data follows certain patterns. Finally, we outline the statistical properties of the various estimators.},

The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

  abstract = {Background: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a common hematologic malignancy. This article aimed to estimate the trends of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) globally from 1990 to 2019., Methods: Data on the NHL burden were explored from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019. The trends of NHL burden were estimated using age-standardized rate (ASR) and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC)., Results: The ASR of NHL incidence showed an increasing trend worldwide from 1990 to 2019, with an EAPC of.56 [95\% CI: 0.45--0.66]. Meanwhile, increasing trends were observed in both sexes and in most geographic regions, particularly East Asia (EAPC = 3.57, 95\% CI: 3.29--3.86). The most pronounced increasing trends were seen in Georgia (EAPC = 4.7, 95\% CI: 4.20--5.21), followed by Belarus and Uzbekistan. However, death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by NHL showed decreasing trends globally, in which the respective EAPCs were -0.09 (95\% CI: -0.17 to -0.02) and -0.28 (95\% CI: -0.35 to -0.22). Decreasing trends were mainly seen in high and high-middle sociodemographic index (SDI) areas. At the national level, the largest increasing trends of death and DALYs were observed in Georgia, in which the respective EAPCs were 4.54 (95\% CI: 4.01--5.07) and 4.97 (95\% CI: 4.42--5.52)., Conclusions: Decreasing trends of death and DALYs caused by NHL were observed worldwide from 1990 to 2019, but NHL remains a substantial challenge globally. The findings would inform the strategies for reducing the burden of NHL.},

  abstract = {Atrazine, one of the most widely used herbicides in the world, threatens human health along with terrestrial and aquatic biota. Recent reports have found atrazine in drinking water to be associated with increased birth defects and incidences of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, with higher levels of significance from exposure to both atrazine and nitrate-N. The Midwest region of the United States, which includes Nebraska, is one of the leading regions for high nitrate-N concentrations and agrochemicals, including atrazine, in surface waters. Therefore, the objective of this study was to provide a case study for completing an environmental risk analysis for the potential exposure of atrazine and nitrate-N to ecosystems and humans through interaction with surface waters using two approaches: (1) Identify watersheds across Nebraska that were at risk for exceeding atrazine and nitrate-N maximum contaminant limits (MCLs) in surface water; and (2) Determine the specific times of year where risks were greatest. Factors were then analyzed using Geographic Information System (GIS) software to identify areas of high risk. Impairments for both nitrate-N and atrazine in the surface water were found predominately during the early growing season in the southeastern region of Nebraska, in watershed areas with the highest amount of corn production and annual precipitation. Further, the methodology developed in this study has the potential for application in regions with higher dependency on surface water to determine multiple agrochemical load influxes from upstream regions and evaluate other surface water contaminants during the same time periods.},

I describe Rubin's original definition of missing at random (MAR), its motivation and criticisms, and his sufficient conditions for ignoring the missingness mechanism for likelihood-based, Bayesian, and frequentist inference. Related definitions, including missing completely at random, always MAR, always missing completely at random, and partially MAR, are also covered. I present a formal argument for weakening Rubin's sufficient conditions for frequentist maximum likelihood inference with precision based on the observed information. Some simple examples of MAR are described, together with an example where the missingness mechanism can be ignored even though MAR does not hold. Alternative approaches to statistical inference based on the likelihood function are reviewed, along with non-likelihood frequentist approaches, including weighted generalized estimating equations. Connections with the causal inference literature are also discussed. Finally, alternatives to Rubin's MAR definition are discussed, including informative missingness, informative censoring, and coarsening at random. The intent is to provide a relatively nontechnical discussion, although some of the underlying issues are challenging and touch on fundamental questions of statistical inference.},

  abstract = {One of the most common karyotypic abnormalities is the t(14;18) translocation, which is found in many lymphomas that have a characteristic follicular morphology. Recent molecular studies have shown that this chromosomal translocation results in the juxtaposition of the candidate proto-oncogene bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia--lymphoma) on chromosome 18 with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14. However, because performing accurate cytogenetic studies in solid hematolymphoid neoplasms is difficult, knowledge of the prevalence of the t(14;18) translocation and, by association, the extent of bcl-2 involvement in human lymphomas is limited. We used a number of chromosome-18 DNA probes to analyze various subtypes of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and test for structural abnormalities near or within the bcl-2 gene. Molecular features of the t(14;18) translocation were found in virtually all follicular neoplasms and about 28 percent of diffuse large-cell lymphomas. No changes in bcl-2 were found in several other subtypes of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including those previously suggested to originate from follicular-center cells and those about which cytogenetic data have been difficult to obtain. Our findings suggest a close pathogenetic relation between bcl-2 and a large group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, both with and without a follicular morphology. The methods employed in this study may be useful in improving the accuracy of diagnosis and subclassification of malignant lymphomas. (N Engl J Med 1987; 317:1185--9.) NONRANDOM chromosomal abnormalities have been described in different histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.1 2 3 4 5 These studies have demonstrated a particularly high incidence of karyotypic abnormalities involving chromosome bands 14q32 and 18q21.
