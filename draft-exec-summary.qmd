title: "Draft: Executive Summary"

This analysis examines the risk of bridge collapse in Omaha, NE, using data from the NTAD
National Bridge Inventory. The data set was filtered to focus on bridges within Nebraska and more specifically Omaha. The results show that approximately 20% of the bridges in Omaha are
categorized as "high risk," meaning they have low structural condition and inventory ratings,
though they are not at immediate risk of collapse. About 2.4% of bridges are identified as being
in a state where collapse is a high risk, due to higher traffic. A smaller portion, 0.15% of
bridges, are at the most risk, these are the most urgent cases with severe degradation.

Given these findings, it is clear that Omaha, NE needs to invest in infrastructure improvement.
Local and state government need to take action by improving overall bridge structural condition
starting with the bridges in the highest risk category. The traffic patterns of the city should
also be analyzed to understand which bridges pose the most risk to commuters on a daily basis.
The public can also help this issue by creating awareness around the lack of care into the
infrastructure of the city of Omaha.
