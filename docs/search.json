    "text": "Preface\nYou are a data scientist for a mid-sized business, in a small group of 3-4 data scientists. You’ve been tasked with creating a report evaluating a scenario for your business. Your colleagues will also be evaluating the same scenario, and your reports will be used in aggregate to determine a consensus (or lack thereof) on the company’s action. The reports will also be used to inform downsizing that is rumored to be coming - you want to ensure your report is better than your peers so that you aren’t as easy to cut.\nYou may talk to your peers who are assigned the same scenario, but you do not want to collaborate too closely, lest you both become targets of the rumored layoffs.\n\nI’ve scaffolded this report for you to make this process easier - as we talk about different sections of a report in class and read about how to create similar sections, you will practice by writing the equivalent section of your report.\nThe basic steps for this task are as follows:\n\nIdentify the research question from the business question\nIdentify data set(s) which are (1) publicly available (you don’t have a budget to pay for private data) and (2) relevant to your task\n\n(HW Week 6) Document your data sets in draft-data-doc.qmd\n\nConduct a statistical analysis to support your answer to your research and business questions\n\nWrite a methods section for your business report corresponding to your statistical analysis\n(HW Week 9) Draft of results section of business report with relevant graphics/visual aids in draft-results.qmd\n\nWrite your report\n\n(HW Week 10) Draft of Intro/Conclusion sections in draft-intro-conclusions.qmd\n(HW Week 11) Draft of Executive summary section in draft-exec-summary.qmd\n\nRevise your report\n\n(HW Week 12 – not turned in) Revise your report\n(HW Week 13) - Rough draft of report due. Create one or more qmd files for your report (you can overwrite or delete intro.qmd and summary.qmd), include the names of each file (in order) in _quarto.yml. You should use references (edit references.bib and use pandoc citations). Make sure your report compiles and looks reasonable in both html and pdf.\nDevelop a presentation to go along with your report (Week 13).

    "text": "Overview:\nThe data that I will be using is from the Department of transportation. This data set is the national bridge inventory collected annually by the DOT. This data was updated on 09-30-2024. This data provides information about all bridges that are on public roads and span over 20 feet across the United States. It contains information about bridge structure, bridge location, bridge rating, along with many other data points. I will be focusing on bridge location, bridge rating, along with daily traffic load.\nDescription listed on website:\n“The National Bridge Inventory details bridges on public roads that include interstate highways, U.S. highways, state and county roads, and publicly accessible bridges located on Federal and Tribal lands. The database includes the location, description, classification, and condition of each bridge. The condition of the structural and bridge management elements of each bridge are cataloged for all bridges on the National Highway System (NHS).\nThe NBI is published annually but its publication location varies. The 2024 (most recent) NBI is published with a map viewer as part of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics National Transportation Atlas Database. The data set is also published through FHWA’s Bridges & Structures site.\nThe National Bridge Inventory can support resilience analysis and detour planning efforts. It provides bridge location, design load and clearance, roadway geometry, rating, posting and structural evaluations, number of lanes, traffic counts, among other variables.” “National Bridge Inventory (NBI)” (n.d.)\nDetailed information:\nThis data is located on a csv file in excel. It contains 116 variables describing various aspects of bridges. I will be focusing my analysis on variables 1,4,5,21, 28-29, 57 - 67,109,113-115. These variables and all information regarding analysis and coding can be found in the code book, Weseman (n.d.).\nProcess:\nThis data will be used to analyze the question regarding the probability that a bridge will collapse in Omaha, NE. This is the reason certain variables will be analyzed and others will not be as much of a factor. The factors that I will use to make this decision will be location of bridge, amount of lanes, amount of traffic, bridge ratings, daily truck traffic, etc. All of this information and more can be found on the NBI website and data set.\n\n\n\n\n“National Bridge Inventory (NBI).” n.d. https://tvar-hub-usdot.hub.arcgis.com/pages/national-bridge-inventory.\n\n\nWeseman, William A. n.d. “Recording and Coding Guide.”",

We can also see fro this data that all of our structural condition ratings are low as the average is below 4 which tells us that the structural condition of the all of these bridges is below par. We can also see that the average daily traffic(ADT_029) median is 2,027 cars per day.

These bridges are further at risk due to the fact that the mean percentage of truck traffic is 26% which is very high compared to most bridges in Omaha, NE. We can see this in the descriptive statistics as the mean of the structural conditions is below 3 which is lower than if the bridges were just at poor condition. We can also see that the average year built of the bridges is slightly newer at 1969. Finally, we can see that median of the average daily traffic is 34353 which is much higher than the previous subset. The next step is to look at the proportion of bridges in Omaha that have a poor condition and that have a poor condition under high traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\nBridges at Risk\nHigh Traffic Bridges at Risk\n\n\n\n\n0.0495868\n0.0141677\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this table we can see that the percent chance that a bridge in Omaha, NE is in poor condition is 5%. Along with that, the percent chance that a bridge in poor condition has high traffic is 1.4%. This tells us that we have a minimal chance of coming across a bridge that is at risk of collapse by structural ratings. This was a solution primarily based on descriptive statistics, we will now create a statistical model to predict a collapse of a bridge. To do this task we must create a collapse variable. This will be done by creating a binary variable that depends on if the bridge condition is poor and is the structural evaluation of the bridge in less than 4. These two variables give us the best insight into if a bridge is at risk of collapse, hence they will be used to create the variable. The data that we have also contains many “NA” values, to take care of this issue will will impute the data, or estimate values for the “NA” values based on information in the data set. The new imputed data set is what we will use to form our model.\nThe model we will use will be the following:\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{P(\\text{collapse_risk} = 1)}{1 - P(\\text{collapse_risk} = 1)}\\right)\n= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{DECK_COND_058} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{OPERATING_RATING_064}\n+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{YEAR_BUILT_027}\n\\]\nThe model above is a generalized linear model, as our response variable is non - normal ( Binomial), this is done using the logit link function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression Summary\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n106.38207258\n29.42735626\n3.615074\n3.002618e-04\n\n\nas.numeric(DECK_COND_058)\n-2.24170551\n0.36919860\n-6.071815\n1.264728e-09\n\n\nOPERATING_RATING_064\n-0.05372844\n0.01977683\n-2.716736\n6.592913e-03\n\n\nas.numeric(YEAR_BUILT_027)\n-0.04815458\n0.01496407\n-3.218014\n1.290814e-03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this model we can see that all variables are significant and should produce accurate results in predicting our response variable on testing data.

This represents the relationship between the bridges that are at risk of collapse that bridges that are not as risk of collapse. We can see that we are getting similar numbers in our prediction to the values contained in the data set. We will now test the accuracy of the model.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\n0.9761905\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this table we can see that our model has a 98% accuracy in predicting our defined collapse variable.

    "text": "This analysis examines the risk of bridge collapse in Omaha, NE, using data from the NTAD National Bridge Inventory. The data set was filtered to focus on bridges within Nebraska and more specifically Omaha. The results show that approximately 20% of the bridges in Omaha are categorized as “high risk,” meaning they have low structural condition and inventory ratings, though they are not at immediate risk of collapse. About 2.4% of bridges are identified as being in a state where collapse is a high risk, due to higher traffic. A smaller portion, 0.15% of bridges, are at the most risk, these are the most urgent cases with severe degradation.\nGiven these findings, it is clear that Omaha, NE needs to invest in infrastructure improvement. Local and state government need to take action by improving overall bridge structural condition starting with the bridges in the highest risk category. The traffic patterns of the city should also be analyzed to understand which bridges pose the most risk to commuters on a daily basis. The public can also help this issue by creating awareness around the lack of care into the infrastructure of the city of Omaha.",

    "text": "When thinking about how to conduct the analysis on percent chance a bridge collapses in Omaha, NE. The first task was a to find a data set that contained all of the information that we would need, and that was the NTAD National Bridge Inventory. This data set described in the data documentation, allows us to attempt to figure out the main question at had what the percent chance that a bridge will collapse in Omaha, NE. This data set was filtered to contain all bridges in Iowa and Nebraska by the state code variable, it was then filtered again to focus in on the Omaha area. This was done by filter statements in R, using state codes, latitudes, and longitudes. This subset of the NTAD data was then used for the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map above shows how the data contains all of the bridges in the Omaha, NE area. This is crucial as our task is limited to this area. The next step in our analysis is to further understand what variables within the data set are useful to us. This decision was made by analyzing the code book and understanding which variables give us key insight into the structure, age, traffic, and condition of the bridges.

We next analyzed the variables that saw that bridge condition was a variable that describes the overall condition of the bridge, which has rating of “P” for poor, “G” for good, and “F” for fair. Bridge condition rating is determined by, ” the lowest rating of National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings for Item 58 (Deck), Item 59 (Superstructure), Item 60 (Substructure), or Item 62 (Culvert). If the lowest rating is greater than or equal to 7, the bridge is classified as Good; if it is less than or equal to 4, the classification is Poor. Bridges rated 5 or 6 are classified as Fair.”, Weseman (n.d.). This allows us to looks at the overall condition of the bridge by looking primarily at one variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see the overall breakdown of how the bridge condition variable is broken down. We now want to take a closer look into what bridges are rated with a condition as “P” or poor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph above shows us the distribution of bridges across Omaha, NE, that have a bridge condition rating of poor. This gives us a good understanding of the bridges at most risk of collapse right now. Another factor that might play a role on if a bridge collapses would be how much traffic a bridge takes in per day. We then created another subset of data from the bridges that have poor condition, and added that the average daily traffic must be greater than 5000 and that is must have over two lanes. This will give us a good picture of major bridges in Omaha, NE that are at risk of collapse that could impact that most people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph above show us the distributed of bridges with a poor condition that undergo high traffic scenarios each day. These bridges could possibly be at higher risk for collapse due to the increase of traffic.\nStatistical analysis was then conducted, first by analyzing the descriptive statistics of both the bridge condition subset and the high traffic subset. This was then extended by finding the percent of bridges that are at a poor condition and poor condition with high traffic respectively. This gave us a basic understanding of what the overall condition was currently. We then had to create a method of prediction, which was done by fitting a linear model. The missing values in the data set were a concern which lead to imputation methods being used by way of the “VIM” package in R. This then allowed us to analyze the data using a linear model creating a method of prediction of when a bridge would collapse in Omaha, NE.\n\n\n\n\nWeseman, William A. n.d. “Recording and Coding Guide.”",
