These bridges are further at risk due to the fact that the mean average daily traffic is 38160 which is very high compared to most bridges in Omaha, NE. It can be shown form the descriptive statistics that the mean of the structural conditions is below 3 which is lower than low traffic bridges. It can also be seen that the average year built is slightly newer at 1969 than bridges that are not high traffic. Finally, it shows that median of the average number of lanes is 3.92 which is much higher than the previous subset. The next step is to look at the proportion of bridges in Omaha that have a poor condition and that have a poor condition under high traffic.\n\n\n3.1.3 Proportion of Bridges in Poor Condition\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Proportion of Bridges at Risk in all of Omaha, NE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridges at Risk\nHigh Traffic Bridges at Risk\n\n\n\n\n0.0496\n0.0142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2 shows that the percent chance that a bridge in Omaha, NE is in poor condition is 4.96 %.

This was a solution primarily based on descriptive statistics, the next step is to develop a model.",

    "text": "3.2 Statistical Model and Analysis\nTo do this task a collapse variable was created. This will be done by creating a binary variable that depends on if the bridge condition is poor and if the structural evaluation of the bridge in less than 4. These two variables give the best insight into if a bridge is at risk of collapse, hence they will be used to create the response variable for the model. The data also contains many “NA” values, to take care of this issue the data will be imputed, or estimated values for the “NA” ’s will be formed based on information in the data set. The new imputed data set is what will be used to form the model, Little (2021).\n\n\n3.2.1 Generalized Linear Model\nThe model used will be the following:\n\\[\n\\log\\left( \\frac{P(\\text{collapse\\_risk} = 1)}{1 - P(\\text{collapse\\_risk} = 1)} \\right)\n= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{DECK\\_COND\\_058} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{OPERATING\\_RATING\\_064}\n+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{YEAR\\_BUILT\\_027}\n\\]\nThe model above is a generalized linear model, as the response variable is non - normal (Binomial), a normal linear model can not be used. The modification is done by using the logit link function. From this model the regression coefficient estimates will be obtained to use for prediction when the next bridge will collapse. The regression coefficients will be found using a training subset of the data (80% of the rows), which will be found using the caret package. This will then allow us to test the prediction capabilities of our model using the remaining 20% of our data, the test data set.\n\n3.2.1.1 Coefficient Estimates\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.4: Regression Model Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n85.34249\n27.41045\n3.114\n1.849e-03\n\n\nas.numeric(DECK_COND_058)\n-1.75009\n0.30765\n-5.689\n1.281e-08\n\n\nOPERATING_RATING_064\n-0.06524\n0.02022\n-3.227\n1.249e-03\n\n\nas.numeric(YEAR_BUILT_027)\n-0.03839\n0.01399\n-2.745\n6.057e-03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.4 shows that all variables are significant by having a p-value less than .05. This means that all of the coefficients will be included in the model for prediction. The prediction capabilities of the model were tested by using the predict function in R. This will allow an understanding of how good the model is at predicting the response variable, collapse risk, in the test data set.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Prediction and Model Accuracy\nFrom the model, when used in prediction on the test data set, the model predicts or analyzed that there is 6.55 % of bridges that are at risk of collapse. This is very similar to the value from the overall data which was 4.13 %. This shows the model is representative of the overall data set and the current condition, the final step is to test the accuracy of the model.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.5: Accuracy of Regression Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\n0.9643\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3 shows that the model has a 96.4% accuracy in predicting the defined collapse risk variable. Which shows that it can be predicted with good accuracy if a bridge is at risk of collapse in Omaha,NE.\n\n\n\n\nLittle, Roderick J. 2021. “Missing Data Assumptions.” Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application 8 (1): 89–107. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-040720-031104.",

    "text": "Have you ever been driving over a bridge and wondering how stable it is? This is a question that has created a lot of buzz recently especially with the state of the infrastructure in the United States. Recently the United States received a C rating on their infrastructure, which is the highest they have ever received, Gomes (2025) . This tells us that the overall infrastructure is slightly improving over time, yet it is still at a C. What does this tell us about the future of infrastructure in this county will it continue to improve or is this just a flash in the pan? This is an important question to ask as many people depend on the bridges and roads in this country to get to their job or to see loved ones and at this point they are not dependable. The most recent example being the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, MD, which collapsed after a cargo ship hit it, DeLetter (2024) . This collapse lead to great economic disruption in the area and also shined a light again on the state of infrastructure in the country. This is the not the first major bridge of its kind to collapse, as the I - 35 W Mississippi River Bridge located in Minneapolis, MN collapsed in 2007. This bridge collapse killed and injured many people, while also causing massive economic disruption as it was the third busiest bridge in Minneapolis, DeLetter (2024) .\nThis past year the National Transportation Safety Board has flagged 68 bridges across the United States that are at risk of collapse from vessel strikes, “NTSB Recommends 68 Bridges in US Be Evaluated for Risk of Collapse from Vessel Strike” (2025) . The NTSB also found that, ” the Key Bridge, which collapsed after being struck by the container ship Dali on March 26, 2024, was almost 30 times above the acceptable risk threshold for critical or essential bridges…” “NTSB Recommends 68 Bridges in US Be Evaluated for Risk of Collapse from Vessel Strike” (2025).\nThese issues throughout the U.S. bring up questions regarding the state of bridges close to home. When looking at the bridge condition in Nebraska, this leads to the discovery that 8.8% of bridges are structurally deficient. It can also be found that 149 dams are considered high hazard potential, and Nebraskans are already paying billions without the issue being solved, “Nebraska Infrastructure Report Card  ASCE” (2025) . This shows that changes need to be made, but what about the condition of bridges in the states biggest city?\nThe question that will be dissected in this report is the probability of a bridge collapse in Omaha, NE. This problem will be answered by analyzing the NDAT National Bridge Inventory data set, which contains a variety of information regarding each bridge in the U.S., more information about the data set can be found in the data documentation. The data set will then be filtered to focus in on the Omaha area including surrounding areas such as Elkhorn, NE and Council Bluffs, IA. The bridge quality and structural integrity will then be analyzed using condition based variables. A linear model will then be constructed using a curated response variable to predict the next bridge collapse. In the end, we aim to understand the probability that a bridge in Omaha is at risk of collapse and have the ability to predict it.\n\n\n\n\nDeLetter, Emily. 2024. “Baltimore’s Key Bridge Is Not the First: A Look at Other Bridge Collapse Events in US History.” USA TODAY. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/26/bridge-collapses-us-history/73103384007/.\n\n\nGomes, Celine. 2025. “America’s Infrastructure Earns Its Highest Rating yet  School of Engineering.” Tufts University. https://engineering.tufts.edu/news-events/news/americas-infrastructure-earns-its-highest-rating-yet.\n\n\n“Nebraska Infrastructure Report Card  ASCE.” 2025.

    "text": "2.1 Overview of Bridges in Omaha,NE\nWhen thinking about how to conduct the analysis on the percent chance a bridge collapses in Omaha, NE, the first step is to find a data set that contains all of the information that is needed. Important information to answer this question would be, how the bridge is structurally, how old it is, and how much traffic the bridge has. The data set that was found is the NTAD National Bridge Inventory, which contains a majority of the information stated above and much more. This data set, described in the data documentation, attempts to figure out the main question at hand, what is the percent chance that a bridge will collapse in Omaha, NE. This data set was filtered to contain all bridges in Iowa and Nebraska by state code, it was then filtered again to focus in on the Omaha area. This was done by filter statements in the dyplr package in R, using state codes, latitudes, and longitudes. This subset of the NTAD data was then used for the analysis.\nFigure 2.1: Map of Omaha Bridges\nFigure 2.1 above shows how the data contains all of the bridges in the Omaha, NE area. This is crucial as the task is limited to this area. This map also gives a broader idea of how bridges are distributed across Omaha, NE allowing assessment of the risk for each area. The next step in the analysis is to further understand what variables within the data set are useful. This decision was made by analyzing the code book and understanding which variables give key insight into the structure, age, traffic, and condition of the bridges. These variables will hopefully lead to the ability to draw a conclusion that meet the goal of predicting a bridge collapse.",

    "text": "2.2 Description of Data\nThere are 130 variables in the NTAD Bridge Inventory data set, some of variables that will be used are: bridge condition, substructure and superstructure condition, average daily traffic, and year built. These variables give a good picture of what it means to be a stable and healthy bridge and also what it means to be a bridge on the verge of collapse. Next, the variable bridge condition was analyzed, which is a variable that describes the overall condition of the bridge, which has rating of “P” for poor, “G” for good, and “F” for fair. Bridge condition rating is determined by, ” the lowest rating of National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings for Item 58 (Deck), Item 59 (Superstructure), Item 60 (Substructure), or Item 62 (Culvert). If the lowest rating is greater than or equal to 7, the bridge is classified as Good; if it is less than or equal to 4, the classification is Poor. Bridges rated 5 or 6 are classified as Fair.”, Weseman (2023). This allows the analysis of the overall condition of the bridge by looking primarily at one variable.\n\n2.2.1 Understanding Bridge Condition Variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Bridge Condtion Ratings Across Omaha, NE\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1 shows the overall breakdown of how the bridge condition variable. When first looking at this graph, it shows that a majority of the bridges in Omaha are in good or fair condition. Next, a closer look was taken into the bridges that have a poor rating.\n\n2.2.1.1 Bridges in Omaha that have a Rating of Poor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Map of Omaha Bridges in ‘Poor’ Condtion\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2 above shows the distribution of bridges across Omaha, NE, that have a bridge condition rating of poor. This gives a good understanding of the bridges at most risk of collapse right now. Figure 5.2 shows that some of the bridges that are at most risk of collapse are in downtown Omaha, which could lead to major economic and logistical issues. The economic impact of a bridge collapse is important for one to consider as it can impact the severity of the incident. Another factor that might play a role on if a bridge collapses would be how much traffic a bridge takes in per day. Another subset of data was created from the bridges that have poor condition. This subset added that the average daily traffic must be greater than 5,000 cars per day and that it must have over two lanes. This will give a good picture of major bridges in Omaha, NE that are at risk of collapse that could impact that most people.\n\n\n2.2.1.2 Bridges in Omaha that have a Rating of Poor and have High Traffic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Map of Omaha Bridges in ‘Poor’ Condtion and with High Traffic\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4 above show the distributed of bridges with a poor condition that undergo high traffic scenarios each day. These bridges could possibly be at higher risk for collapse due to the increase of traffic. The map above shows that none of these bridges are located over water which may mitigate the damage and economic impact of a collapse. The bridges that are at a poor rating and have high traffic are not located in downtown Omaha, which again could limit the economic impact of a collapse.",

    "text": "When looking back at the opening question, do you ever think of how stable a bridge is when you are driving over top of it, if so you have found the right place. This is because in the analysis we have found that 4.96% of the bridges in the Omaha,NE area have a bridge rating of “poor”. We have also see that 1.42% of bridges are considered high traffic bridges and also have a “poor” rating. This shows that in Omaha, NE if you took a random sample of 100 bridges, 5 would come out with a “poor” rating. This is a major issue highlighting the lack of infrastructure maintenance and repair in Nebraska. This is a future concern and with bridges and roads only getting older it is time to put more money and research into how to maintain the aging infrastructure.\nThis prompted further investigation using the National Bridge Inventory data set. This lead to the creation of a collapse variable, based on summary variables, and the formation of a generalized linear model. This was done to try and estimate the proportion of bridges that are at risk of collapse. The model estimated that 2.98 % of bridges in Omaha are at risk of collapse. This is similar to what was found in the descriptive statistics and was predicted with a 97.6% accuracy.\nSome issues that occured in the analysis, are that there is no specifically defined criteria for if a bridge is going to collapse. This creates a issue when trying to predict or categorize a collapse. This lead to analyzing the descriptive statistics while also formulating a variable that categorized risk of collapse. This collapse variable was formed from two variables, that were summary variables in themselves of bridge condition and structure. This lead to a variable that in many ways categorized the risk of collapse. The data set itself contains a lot of missing values, which is difficult to deal with, hence when the model was created an imputed data set was used so that those missing values were then estimated.\nFuture implications of this research is using this model to further categorize bridges as at risk or needing attention. This will allow researchers to quickly evaluate if a bridge is in need of attention. This could allow government officials to act quicker if they know the proportion of bridges that are at risk in there district or state. This will also lead to more economical solutions as if at risk bridges can be identified then preventative measures can be taken. Overall, the main product of this analysis is that bridges are not in good condition and money needs to be allocated to help mend and fix bridges. This is to prevent and bring awareness to bridge collapses in a major cities like the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, MD.",

The U.S.recently received its highest-ever infrastructure grade of a C, concerns remain about long-term safety and reliability, “Nebraska Infrastructure Report Card  ASCE” (2025). High-profile failures like the 2024 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and the 2007 I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis highlight the risks and consequences of aging structures, DeLetter (2024). The National Transportation Safety Board has since identified 68 bridges at high risk of collapse from vessel strikes, with the Key Bridge found to be nearly 30 times over the acceptable risk threshold, “NTSB Recommends 68 Bridges in US Be Evaluated for Risk of Collapse from Vessel Strike” (2025). In Nebraska, 8.8% of bridges are structurally deficient, and 149 dams pose high hazard potential, raising questions about local infrastructure—especially in Omaha, NE. This report analyzes bridge condition data from the National Bridge Inventory, focusing on Omaha and finding the proportion of bridges that are at most risk of collapse.

This data was updated on 09-30-2024. This data provides information about all bridges that are on public roads and span over 20 feet across the United States. It contains information about bridge structure, bridge location, bridge rating, along with many other data points. I will be focusing on bridge location, bridge rating, along with daily traffic load.\nDescription listed on website:\n“The National Bridge Inventory details bridges on public roads that include interstate highways, U.S. highways, state and county roads, and publicly accessible bridges located on Federal and Tribal lands. The database includes the location, description, classification, and condition of each bridge. The condition of the structural and bridge management elements of each bridge are cataloged for all bridges on the National Highway System (NHS).\nThe NBI is published annually but its publication location varies. The 2024 (most recent) NBI is published with a map viewer as part of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics National Transportation Atlas Database. The data set is also published through FHWA’s Bridges & Structures site.\nThe National Bridge Inventory can support resilience analysis and detour planning efforts. It provides bridge location, design load and clearance, roadway geometry, rating, posting and structural evaluations, number of lanes, traffic counts, among other variables.” “National Bridge Inventory (NBI)” (2024)\nDetailed information:\nThis data is located on a csv file in excel. It contains 116 variables describing various aspects of bridges. I will be focusing my analysis on variables 1,4,5,21, 28-29, 57 - 67,109,113-115. These variables and all information regarding analysis and coding can be found in the code book, Weseman (2023).\nProcess:\nThis data will be used to analyze the question regarding the probability that a bridge will collapse in Omaha, NE. This is the reason certain variables will be analyzed and others will not be as much of a factor.

    "text": "5.2 Methods\nWhen looking at the National Bridge Inventory data, the first task is to get an overall picture of the bridges in Omaha, NE that are in poor condition, according to the bridge condition variable. This variable describes the bridge structural condition as good, fair, or poor; based on the bridge’s structural condition ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Bridge Condtion Ratings Across Omaha, NE\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1 shows the distribution of the bridge condition variable and how many bridges in the Omaha area have a rating of poor. The next step is to get a visual representation of the bridges that are in poor condition in Omaha, NE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Map of Omaha Bridges in ‘Poor’ Condtion\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2 shows the visual distribution of the bridges that are in poor condition and gives a good understanding of the bridges at most risk of collapse right now. Figure 5.2 shows that some of the bridges that are at most risk of collapse are in downtown Omaha, which could lead to major economic and logistical issues. The economic impact of a bridge collapse is important for one to consider as it can impact the severity of the incident. The next step is looking at bridges that have high traffic and are in poor condition. The statistical analysis can then take place by finding the proportion of bridges that are in poor condition and comparing that to the proportion of bridges that are in poor condition and have high traffic. The analysis will continue with creating a linear model to predict bridge collapse and finally comparing the models predicted results to figure out its accuracy.",

This data also shows that all of the structural condition ratings are low, as the average is shockingly below 4 (out of 10). Also, the average daily traffic (ADT_029) mean is 12240 cars per day. The proportion of bridges that are in poor condition and poor condition with high traffic will show the severity of the infrastructure issue in Omaha, NE.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Proportion of Bridges at Risk in all of Omaha, NE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridges at Risk\nHigh Traffic Bridges at Risk\n\n\n\n\n0.0496\n0.0142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2 shows that the percent chance that a bridge in Omaha, NE is in poor condition is 4.96 %. Along with that, the percent chance that a bridge in poor condition has high traffic is 1.42%. This tells us that there is a minimal chance of coming across a bridge that is at risk of collapse by structural ratings. This was a solution primarily based on descriptive statistics, the next step is to develop a model. To do this task a collapse variable was created. This will be done by creating a binary variable that depends on if the bridge condition is poor and if the structural evaluation of the bridge in less than 4. These two variables give the best insight into if a bridge is at risk of collapse, hence they will be used to create the response variable for the model. An imputed estimation of missing values was used to form this model as the original data set contained many “NA” values.\nThe model is the following:\n\\[\n\\log\\left( \\frac{P(\\text{collapse\\_risk} = 1)}{1 - P(\\text{collapse\\_risk} = 1)} \\right)\n= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{DECK\\_COND\\_058} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{OPERATING\\_RATING\\_064}\n+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{YEAR\\_BUILT\\_027}\n\\]\nThe model above is a generalized linear model, as the response variable is non - normal (Binomial), a normal linear model can not be used. The modification is done by using the logit link function. The regression coefficients will be found using a training subset of the data (80% of the rows), which will be found using the caret package. This will then allow us to test the prediction capabilities of our model using the remaining 20% of our data, the test data set. The prediction capabilities of this model were then tested using the predict function in R.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3: Accuracy of Regression Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\n0.9821\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the model, when used in prediction on the test data set, the model predicts or analyzed that there is 0.595 % of bridges that are at risk of collapse. This is very similar to the value from the overall data which was 4.13 %. This shows the model is representative of the overall data set and the current condition, the final step is to test the accuracy of the model. Table 5.3 shows that the model has a 98.2% accuracy in predicting the defined collapse risk variable. Which shows that it can be predicted with good accuracy if a bridge is at risk of collapse in Omaha,NE.",

    "text": "5.4 Conclusion\nWhen looking back at the opening question, do you ever think of how stable a bridge is when you are driving over top of it, then you have found the right place. This is because in the analysis we have found that 4.96% of the bridges in the Omaha,NE area have a bridge rating of “poor”. This shows that in Omaha, NE if you took a random sample of 100 bridges, 5 would come out with a “poor” rating. This is a major issue highlighting the lack of infrastructure maintenance and repair in the country. This prompted further investigation using the National Bridge Inventory data set which lead to the creation of a collapse variable based on summary variables and the formation of a generalized linear model. The model estimated that 0.595 % of bridges in Omaha are at risk of collapse. This is similar to what was found in the descriptive statistics and was predicted with a 98.2% accuracy.\nSome issues that occur in the analysis is that there is no specifically defined criteria for if a bridge is going to collapse. This creates a issue when trying to predict or categorize if a bridge will collapse. This lead to the analyzing the descriptive statistics while also formulating a variable that categorized risk of collapse. This collapse variable was formed from two variables that were summary variables in themselves of bridge condition and structure. This lead to a variable that in many ways categorized the risk of collapse. Future implications of this research is using this model to further categorize bridges as at risk or needing attention. This will allow researchers to quickly evaluate if a bridge is in need of attention. Overall, the main product of this analysis is that bridges are not in good condition and money needs to be allocated to help mend and fix bridges so that we do not have another collapse in a major city like the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, MD.\n\n\n\n\nDeLetter, Emily. 2024. “Baltimore’s Key Bridge Is Not the First: A Look at Other Bridge Collapse Events in US History.” USA TODAY. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/26/bridge-collapses-us-history/73103384007/.\n\n\n“Nebraska Infrastructure Report Card  ASCE.” 2025.

    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nHave you ever driven over a bridge and wondered how stable it is? The U.S.recently received its highest-ever infrastructure grade of a C, concerns remain about long-term safety and reliability, “Nebraska Infrastructure Report Card  ASCE” (2025). High-profile failures like the 2024 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and the 2007 I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis highlight the risks and consequences of aging structures, DeLetter (2024). The National Transportation Safety Board has since identified 68 bridges at high risk of collapse from vessel strikes, with the Key Bridge found to be nearly 30 times over the acceptable risk threshold, “NTSB Recommends 68 Bridges in US Be Evaluated for Risk of Collapse from Vessel Strike” (2025). In Nebraska, 8.8% of bridges are structurally deficient, and 149 dams pose high hazard potential, raising questions about local infrastructure—especially in Omaha, NE. This report analyzes bridge condition data from the National Bridge Inventory, focusing on Omaha and finding the proportion of bridges that are at most risk of collapse. Assessing the probability of bridge collapse will be done by using condition-based variables and predictive modeling.",

    "text": "Project Description\nYou are a data scientist for a mid-sized business, in a small group of 3-4 data scientists. You’ve been tasked with creating a report evaluating a scenario for your business. Your colleagues will also be evaluating the same scenario, and your reports will be used in aggregate to determine a consensus (or lack thereof) on the company’s action. The reports will also be used to inform downsizing that is rumored to be coming - you want to ensure your report is better than your peers so that you aren’t as easy to cut.\nYou may talk to your peers who are assigned the same scenario, but you do not want to collaborate too closely, lest you both become targets of the rumored layoffs.\n\nI’ve scaffolded this report for you to make this process easier - as we talk about different sections of a report in class and read about how to create similar sections, you will practice by writing the equivalent section of your report.\nThe basic steps for this task are as follows:\n\nIdentify the research question from the business question\nIdentify data set(s) which are (1) publicly available (you don’t have a budget to pay for private data) and (2) relevant to your task\n\n(HW Week 6) Document your data sets in draft-data-doc.qmd\n\nConduct a statistical analysis to support your answer to your research and business questions\n\nWrite a methods section for your business report corresponding to your statistical analysis\n(HW Week 9) Draft of results section of business report with relevant graphics/visual aids in draft-results.qmd\n\nWrite your report\n\n(HW Week 10) Draft of Intro/Conclusion sections in draft-intro-conclusions.qmd\n(HW Week 11) Draft of Executive summary section in draft-exec-summary.qmd\n\nRevise your report\n\n(HW Week 12 – not turned in) Revise your report\n(HW Week 13) - Rough draft of report due. Create one or more qmd files for your report (you can overwrite or delete intro.qmd and summary.qmd), include the names of each file (in order) in _quarto.yml. You should use references (edit references.bib and use pandoc citations). Make sure your report compiles and looks reasonable in both html and pdf.\nDevelop a presentation to go along with your report (Week 13). Create slides for your report using quarto.\n\nPeer revise reports\n\nPeer revise reports\n(HW Week 14) - Make edits to your report from comments received from peer review\n\nFinal report & presentation due",
