    "text": "Preface\nYou are a data scientist for a mid-sized business, in a small group of 3-4 data scientists. You’ve been tasked with creating a report evaluating a scenario for your business. Your colleagues will also be evaluating the same scenario, and your reports will be used in aggregate to determine a consensus (or lack thereof) on the company’s action. The reports will also be used to inform downsizing that is rumored to be coming - you want to ensure your report is better than your peers so that you aren’t as easy to cut.\nYou may talk to your peers who are assigned the same scenario, but you do not want to collaborate too closely, lest you both become targets of the rumored layoffs.\n\nI’ve scaffolded this report for you to make this process easier - as we talk about different sections of a report in class and read about how to create similar sections, you will practice by writing the equivalent section of your report.\nThe basic steps for this task are as follows:\n\nIdentify the research question from the business question\nIdentify data set(s) which are (1) publicly available (you don’t have a budget to pay for private data) and (2) relevant to your task\n\n(HW Week 6) Document your data sets in draft-data-doc.qmd\n\nConduct a statistical analysis to support your answer to your research and business questions\n\nWrite a methods section for your business report corresponding to your statistical analysis\n(HW Week 9) Draft of results section of business report with relevant graphics/visual aids in draft-results.qmd\n\nWrite your report\n\n(HW Week 10) Draft of Intro/Conclusion sections in draft-intro-conclusions.qmd\n(HW Week 11) Draft of Executive summary section in draft-exec-summary.qmd\n\nRevise your report\n\n(HW Week 12 – not turned in) Revise your report\n(HW Week 13) - Rough draft of report due. Create one or more qmd files for your report (you can overwrite or delete intro.qmd and summary.qmd), include the names of each file (in order) in _quarto.yml. You should use references (edit references.bib and use pandoc citations). Make sure your report compiles and looks reasonable in both html and pdf.\nDevelop a presentation to go along with your report (Week 13). Create slides for your report using quarto.\n\nPeer revise reports\n\nPeer revise reports\n(HW Week 14) - Make edits to your report from comments received from peer review\n\nFinal report & presentation due",

    "text": "Overview:\nThe data that I will be using is from the Department of transportation. This data set is the national bridge inventory collected annually by the DOT. This data was updated on 09-30-2024. This data provides information about all bridges that are on public roads and span over 20 feet across the United States. It contains information about bridge structure, bridge location, bridge rating, along with many other data points. I will be focusing on bridge location, bridge rating, along with daily traffic load.\nDescription listed on website:\n“The National Bridge Inventory details bridges on public roads that include interstate highways, U.S. highways, state and county roads, and publicly accessible bridges located on Federal and Tribal lands. The database includes the location, description, classification, and condition of each bridge. The condition of the structural and bridge management elements of each bridge are cataloged for all bridges on the National Highway System (NHS).\nThe NBI is published annually but its publication location varies. The 2024 (most recent) NBI is published with a map viewer as part of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics National Transportation Atlas Database. The data set is also published through FHWA’s Bridges & Structures site.\nThe National Bridge Inventory can support resilience analysis and detour planning efforts. It provides bridge location, design load and clearance, roadway geometry, rating, posting and structural evaluations, number of lanes, traffic counts, among other variables.” “National Bridge Inventory (NBI)” (n.d.)\nDetailed information:\nThis data is located on a csv file in excel. It contains 116 variables describing various aspects of bridges. I will be focusing my analysis on variables 1,4,5,21, 28-29, 57 - 67,109,113-115. These variables and all information regarding analysis and coding can be found in the code book, Weseman (n.d.).\nProcess:\nThis data will be used to analyze the question regarding the probability that a bridge will collapse in Omaha, NE. This is the reason certain variables will be analyzed and others will not be as much of a factor. The factors that I will use to make this decision will be location of bridge, amount of lanes, amount of traffic, bridge ratings, daily truck traffic, etc. All of this information and more can be found on the NBI website and data set.\n\n\n\n\n“National Bridge Inventory (NBI).” n.d. https://tvar-hub-usdot.hub.arcgis.com/pages/national-bridge-inventory.\n\n\nWeseman, William A. n.d. “Recording and Coding Guide.”",

we are given a summary of the data and each variable and some descriptions attached. This data was then used to break down which bridges have the highest chance of collapsing in Omaha, NE. The criteria for collapsing was based on a variety of factors in the data set that have been filtered in R. This filtering allowed me to see which bridges have the lowest quality structure, maintenance, and most traffic.\n\npercents &lt;- data.frame(\n  \"bridges at risk\" = nrow(bridge_cond)/nrow(fil_dat),\n  \"High traffic bridges at risk\" = nrow(high_traffic)/nrow(fil_dat)\n)\n\n\ntable &lt;- t(percents)\nkable(table, caption = \"Proportion of Bridges at risk of Collapse\")\n\n\nProportion of Bridges at risk of Collapse\n\n\nbridges.at.risk\n0.0495868\n\n\nHigh.traffic.bridges.at.risk\n0.0141677\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from this table that we have four different categories; high risk, collapse, collapsing soon, and casualties. This four groups were created to see the proportion of bridges that were in the worst state. The high risk category being the lowest risk of collapse and collapsing soon being the highest risk of collapse. We can see from these results that we have a 20% chance of driving on a high risk bridge in Omaha, NE. Along with that we have a 2.4% chance of driving on bridge that could collapse. Finally we have a .15% chance of being on a bridge that could collapse in the near future. This is just a rating system created by me so that we can estimate the proportion of bridges that are at risk of collapse based on traffic data and structural ratings.

    "text": "This analysis examines the risk of bridge collapse in Omaha, NE, using data from the NTAD National Bridge Inventory. The data set was filtered to focus on bridges within Nebraska and more specifically Omaha. The results show that approximately 20% of the bridges in Omaha are categorized as “high risk,” meaning they have low structural condition and inventory ratings, though they are not at immediate risk of collapse. About 2.4% of bridges are identified as being in a state where collapse is a high risk, due to higher traffic. A smaller portion, 0.15% of bridges, are at the most risk, these are the most urgent cases with severe degradation.\nGiven these findings, it is clear that Omaha, NE needs to invest in infrastructure improvement. Local and state government need to take action by improving overall bridge structural condition starting with the bridges in the highest risk category. The traffic patterns of the city should also be analyzed to understand which bridges pose the most risk to commuters on a daily basis. The public can also help this issue by creating awareness around the lack of care into the infrastructure of the city of Omaha.",

    "text": "When thinking about how to conduct the analysis on percent chance a bridge collapses in Omaha, NE. The first task was a to find a data set that contained all of the information that we would need, and that was the NTAD National Bridge Inventory. This data set described in the data documentation, allows us to attempt to figure out the main question at had what the percent chance that a bridge will collapse in Omaha, NE. This data set was filtered to contain all bridges in Iowa and Nebraska by the state code variable, it was then filtered again to focus in on the Omaha area. This was done by filter statements in R, using state codes, latitudes, and longitudes. This subset of the NTAD data was then used for the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map above shows how the data contains all of the bridges in the Omaha, NE area. This is crucial as our task is limited to this area. The next step in our analysis is to further understand what variables within the data set are useful to us. This decision was made by analyzing the code book and understanding which variables give us key insight into the structure, age, traffic, and condition of the bridges. These variables will hopefully lead us to be able to draw a conclusion that meet our goal of predicting a bridge collapse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nclasses\nfirst_values\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID\ninteger\n160255, 160256, 160257, 160258, 160259, 160260\n\n\nSTATE_CODE_001\ninteger\n19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19\n\n\nROUTE_PREFIX_005B\ninteger\n5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5\n\n\nFACILITY_CARRIED_007\ncharacter\n5TH AVE, 2ND AVE, COLLEGE RD, ELLIOTT ST, W ORCHARD AVE, SYLVAN DR\n\n\nLAT_016\ndouble\n41.2569444444444, 41.2594444444444, 41.2688888888889, 41.2791666666667, 41.2802777777778, 41.2841666666667\n\n\nLONG_017\ndouble\n-95.8647222222222, -95.8647222222222, -95.8075, -95.8355555555555, -95.8355555555555, -95.8361111111111\n\n\nMAINTENANCE_021\ninteger\n4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4\n\n\nYEAR_BUILT_027\ninteger\n1935, 1992, 1980, 1987, 1987, 1988\n\n\nTRAFFIC_LANES_ON_028A\ninteger\n2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2\n\n\nADT_029\ninteger\n3013, 2223, 644, 1534, 684, 1002\n\n\nYEAR_ADT_030\ninteger\n2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022\n\n\nDECK_COND_058\ncharacter\n4, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7\n\n\nSUPERSTRUCTURE_COND_059\ncharacter\n4, 7, 8, 6, 7, 7\n\n\nSUBSTRUCTURE_COND_060\ncharacter\n4, 8, 7, 6, 7, 7\n\n\nCHANNEL_COND_061\ncharacter\n8, 7, 6, 6, 8, 6\n\n\nCULVERT_COND_062\ncharacter\nN, N, N, N, N, N\n\n\nOPR_RATING_METH_063\ncharacter\n1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0\n\n\nOPERATING_RATING_064\ndouble\n36.7, 47.7, 52.1, 99.9, 99.9, 44.5\n\n\nINV_RATING_METH_065\ncharacter\n1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0\n\n\nINVENTORY_RATING_066\ndouble\n22, 28.6, 31.2, 57.1, 57.1, 32.7\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL_EVAL_067\ninteger\n4, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7\n\n\nFRACTURE_092A\ncharacter\nN, N, N, N, N, N\n\n\nTRAFFIC_DIRECTION_102\ninteger\n2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2\n\n\nYEAR_RECONSTRUCTED_106\ninteger\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\n\nPERCENT_ADT_TRUCK_109\ninteger\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\n\nSCOUR_CRITICAL_113\ncharacter\n8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8\n\n\nBRIDGE_CONDITION\ncharacter\nP, F, F, F, G, G\n\n\nLOWEST_RATING\ninteger\n4, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7\n\n\nDECK_AREA\ndouble\n164.82, 212.4, 708.01, 110.21, 110.21, 103.02\n\n\nSTATUS\ncharacter\nST, ST, ST, ST, ST, ST\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table above shows the variables from the data set that will be used to analyze the data as they describe key components about each bridge. We next analyzed the variables that saw that bridge condition was a variable that describes the overall condition of the bridge, which has rating of “P” for poor, “G” for good, and “F” for fair. Bridge condition rating is determined by, ” the lowest rating of National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings for Item 58 (Deck), Item 59 (Superstructure), Item 60 (Substructure), or Item 62 (Culvert). If the lowest rating is greater than or equal to 7, the bridge is classified as Good; if it is less than or equal to 4, the classification is Poor. Bridges rated 5 or 6 are classified as Fair.”, Weseman (n.d.). This allows us to looks at the overall condition of the bridge by looking primarily at one variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see the overall breakdown of how the bridge condition variable is broken down. We now want to take a closer look into what bridges are rated with a condition as “P” or poor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph above shows us the distribution of bridges across Omaha, NE, that have a bridge condition rating of poor. This gives us a good understanding of the bridges at most risk of collapse right now. Another factor that might play a role on if a bridge collapses would be how much traffic a bridge takes in per day. We then created another subset of data from the bridges that have poor condition, and added that the average daily traffic must be greater than 5000 and that is must have over two lanes. This will give us a good picture of major bridges in Omaha, NE that are at risk of collapse that could impact that most people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph above show us the distributed of bridges with a poor condition that undergo high traffic scenarios each day. These bridges could possibly be at higher risk for collapse due to the increase of traffic.\nStatistical analysis was then conducted, first by analyzing the descriptive statistics of both the bridge condition subset and the high traffic subset. This was then extended by finding the percent of bridges that are at a poor condition and poor condition with high traffic respectively. This gave us a basic understanding of what the overall condition was currently. We then had to create a method of prediction, which was done by fitting a linear model. The missing values in the data set were a concern which lead to imputation methods being used by way of the “VIM” package in R. This then allowed us to analyze the data using a linear model creating a method of prediction of when a bridge would collapse in Omaha, NE.\n\n\n\n\nWeseman, William A. n.d. “Recording and Coding Guide.”",
