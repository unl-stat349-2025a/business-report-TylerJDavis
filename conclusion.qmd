When looking back at the opening question, do you ever think of how stable a bridge is when you are driving over top of it, the answer would be hopefully not. This is because in our analysis we have found that 5% of the bridges in the Omaha,NE area have a bridge rating of "poor". We have also see that 1.4 % of bridges are considered high traffic bridges and also have a "poor" rating. This tells us that in Omaha, NE if you took a random sample of 100 bridges, 5 would come out with a "poor" rating. This is a major issue highlighting the lack of infrastructure mantinence and repair in our country. This is a future concern and with bridges and roads only getting older it is time to put more money and research into how to maintain our aging infrastructure. This lead to further investigation using the National Bridge Inventory data set which lead us to create a collapse variable based on important variables and then try to predict, from the data we have, which bridges are at most risk of collapse. The model we developed predicted our collapse variable with 98% accuracy showing that with this data set there is the ability to predict which bridges are at most risk of collapse. The predicted percentage of bridges that were at risk of collapse was the a very similar percentage to the percentage in our actual data.

Some issues with the data set are that there are a lot of missing values this was difficult to handle especially with the amount of variables that we have in our data set. This forced us to use imputation methods to estimate our missing values, this allowed us to use much more of our data than if we did not do this. Some future implications of this analysis and data, would be taking similar approaches to see which bridges are in the worst condition. This will allow governments to allocate resources to the proper locations creating more understanding in which bridges need the most work.
